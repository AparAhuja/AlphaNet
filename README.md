# AlphaNet - Noisy Image Captioning
AlphaNet is a neural network that reads noisy captions embedded in images. AlphaNet was developed by Apar Ahuja and Arnav Tuli. The architecture was designed and trained from scratch; no pre-trained models were used. The model was implemented using PyTorch. It consists of CNNs as image encoders and LSTM with attention as decoders. Basic edge detection techniques were used to preprocess the data. Preprocessing was complemented by teacher forcing and beam search to improve model performance. All the models were trained with CUDA GPU acceleration on high-performance servers at IIT Delhi.
