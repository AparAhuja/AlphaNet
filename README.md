# AlphaNet - Noisy Image Captioning
AlphaNet is a neural network that reads noisy captions embedded in images. The architecture was designed and trained from scratch; no pre-trained models were used. The model used PyTorch as the primary Machine Learning framework. AlphaNet uses CNNs as image encoders and LSTM cells with attention as decoders. Basic edge detection techniques were used to preprocess the input images. Preprocessing was complemented by teacher forcing and beam search to improve model performance. All the models were trained with CUDA GPU acceleration on high-performance servers at IIT Delhi.
